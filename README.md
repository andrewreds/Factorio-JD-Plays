JD P0ober Split Factory
==============

There is an unpassable divide splitting the map in half; east and west. P0ober has the west side as her home, while JD has the east side.
- Both sides are on the same team, sharing research progress, etc.
- When a player dies they will always respawn on their home side of the divide.
- Underground belts can go under the divide, while power pole wires and robots can go over the divide.
- There is a teleport on each side that can transfer the player's conscience into a cloned body on the other side of the divide. The cloned body can only be controlled for 15 minutes before you're returned to a new body on your own side. When a conscience leaves a body for any reason the body dies.
- Spider vehicles will be blocked from walking over (or near) the divide.
