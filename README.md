# Factorio-JD-Plays


A mod for streamer JD-Plays's server. Includes a number of distinct modes.

All older months from 0.17 removed from mod as part of upgrade to 0.18.


March 2020 - Easter Egg Suprise
================

- Tested with Factorio 0.18.17
- Expected Mods: Biter Eggs
- When Biter Egg Nests are destroyed and the chance of neither biters or worms occurs, some random items will be revealed as being witihn the nest. 
- These random items will be 1 item per small egg nest and 1-3 items per large egg nest. 
- These items can include nearly every item in the game (vanilla and map editor specail items) with very few exceptions.
- There won't be a repeat item within the same destroyed egg nest.
