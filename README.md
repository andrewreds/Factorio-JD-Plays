JD P0ober Split Factory
==============

There is an unpassable divide splitting the map in half; east and west. P0ober has the west side as her home, while JD has the east side.
- Both sides are on the same team, sharing research progress, etc.
- When a player dies they will respawn on their home side of the divide.
- Underground belts can go under the divide, while power pole wires and robots can go over the divide.
- There is a teleport on each side to transfer the player's conscience to a clone body on the other side. After 15 minutes the clone body will deteriate, transfering the consience back to the players real body.
- Spider vehicles will be returned if they cross the divide, although they can walk over it techncially.
- Command to set other named player on either JD or P00ber's team.
