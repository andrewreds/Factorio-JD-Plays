Expected Mods: Biter Eggs

When Biter Egg Nests are destroyed and the chance of neither biters or worms occurs, some random items will be revealed as being witihn the nest. Theres 1 item per small egg nest and 1-3 items per large egg nest. These items can include nearly every item in the game (vanilla and map editor only). There won't be a repeat item within the same destroyed egg nest.
