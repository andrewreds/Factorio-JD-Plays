May 2019
---------

- Players start with: 8 iron plate, 1 wood, 1 burner mining drill, 1 stone furnace, 10 research approperiate ammo, 1 research approperiate bullet gun
- Players respawn with: 10 research approperiate ammo, 1 research approperiate bullet gun
- Every 20-45 minutes 80 enemies will spawn in a 100 tile radius around a specific player. They will be evolution approperiate +10% and will individually target that player. There will be 3 seconds of dirt borrowing effect before each biter will come up. Should the targeted player die during this time the biters will continue to come up and target the spawn area on that surface. If no players are alive anywhere the biters will target spawn on the nauvis surface.
- A small GUI will count down to the next biter hunter group and when there is a current group show who is being targeted.
- The success of a biter hunt group vs the targeted player is broadcast in game chat using icons and stored for future modding use in an ingame persistent table. The winner is whoever lasts the longest out of the special biters and the targeted player after the biter hunt group targets the player, regardless of cause of death. Should neither have won by the next biter hunt group it is declared a draw.
- Added a character-corpse image as the default game one is of an alive player.
- Use Extra Biter Control mod and increase the pathfinder limits by atleast 5 to ensure all biters path to target quickly.
