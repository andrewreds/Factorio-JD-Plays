JD P0ober Split Factory
==============

There is an unpassable divide splitting the map in half; east and west. P0ober has the west side as her home, while JD has the east side.
- Both sides are on the same team, sharing research progress, etc.
- When a player dies they will respawn on their home side of the divide.
- Underground belts can go under the divide, while power pole wires and robots can go over the divide.
- There is a teleport on each side to transfer and keep the player's conscience in a cloned body on the other side. The control across the divide can be maintained for 15 minutes before the conscience is transferred back to another body on their own side. When a conscience leaves a body the body dies.
- Spider vehicles will be blocked from walking over (or near) the divide.

TODO:
    - Add massive power drain in cycles while teleporter is in use. Have a check that the teleporter is connected to the main power network when used and while in use.
